This code will take a raw dataset and clean it appropriately. After the raw dataset is cleaned, it will load the cleaned dataset into a new csv file. The cleaning methods that are used include standardizing column names, standardizing string values, removing leading and trailing white space, using different filling methods to appropriately fill any missing values, and dropping any rows that do not contribute to any sales data/revenue. This will make the data cleaner and make the analysis process more efficient.

To run this code, make sure either python app.py or python3 app.py are installed

Example output: First 5 rows of the raw dataset and then a message reading "First few rows of cleaned dataset:" followed by the first 5 rows of cleaned dataset
